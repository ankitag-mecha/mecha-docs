# Enable Networking For Your Machine

### Prerequisite:

Before you begin, ensure that you have at least one network available to connect the machines to. By default, a network named **‘Default’** is included in your account. This default network is pre-selected from the list of available networks when connecting a machine. You may either create a new network or update the existing **‘Default’** network to suit your specific needs.

### Step 1: Initiating the Network Addition

There are two ways to start the process of adding a machine to a network:

1. **Via Machine Listing:**
    - Locate the machine in the listing and click **‘Enable’** under the IP address section of the machine you want to configure.
2. **Via Machine Details:**
    - Go to **Settings > Networking** within the machine details page and click **‘Enable’** to start the process.

### Step 2: Configure Network Settings

Once you initiate the process, a new modal will appear for configuring the network settings:

1. **Choose Network:**
    - Select the network you want to add the machine to from the dropdown list.
2. **Specify IPv4 Subnet Address:**
    - You can either accept the suggested address, generate a new one by clicking on the icon, or enter a custom IPv4 address.
3. **Enter the DNS Name:**
    - You can choose the suggested DNS name or specify one of your own.
    
    After entering all the required information, click **Save** to apply the settings.

### Step 3: Repeat for Additional Machines

Repeat Step 2 for each additional machine you want to connect to the network.

### Step 4: Confirm Network Settings

After saving, you can confirm the network settings in the following ways:

1. **Via Machine Listing:**
    - Check that the IP address has been assigned to the machine as specified in the previous step.
2. **Via Machine Details:**
    - Navigate to **Settings > Networking** within the machine details page to see all the network details as configured.
3. **Via Network Details:**
    - Ensure that the newly added machine is listed in the network nodes table of the targeted network.

# Delete Network From Console

Follow these steps to delete a network in your management console:

### Step 1: Access the Networking Section

1. **Login to your Console**: Start by logging into your console.
2. **Navigate to Networking**: Click on the "Networking" tab at the top of the console.

### Step 2: Select the Network to Delete

1. **Locate the Network**: In the "Networks" section, you will see a list of networks.
2. **Open Network Options**: Find the network you want to delete and click on the three vertical dots (`â‹®`) next to it.

### Step 3: Initiate the Deletion Process

1. **Select "Delete"**: In the dropdown menu that appears, click on "Delete".
2. **Review the Warning**: A warning message will pop up, notifying you that deleting the network will remove all existing data associated with it.

### Step 4: Confirm the Deletion

1. **Enter Network Name**: To confirm the deletion, you need to type in the exact name of the network in the provided text field.
2. **Confirm Delete**: Once the name is entered, click on the "Confirm Delete" button to finalize the process.

### Step 5: Success Notification

- After confirming, a toast notification will appear at the bottom of the screen: **"Network deleted successfully"**.

### Important Notes:

- **Irreversible Action**: Deleting a network will permanently remove all data associated with that network. Make sure you have backed up any important information before proceeding.
- **Default Network**: If the network is set as the default, you might want to set a new default network before deleting.

This completes the process of deleting a network in your console.

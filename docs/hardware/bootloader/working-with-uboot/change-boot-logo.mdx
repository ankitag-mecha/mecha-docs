1. **Prepare Your Custom Image**:
    - Create or choose an image you want to use as the boot logo.
    - Ensure the image is in BMP format and has a similar resolution to the existing logo (e.g., 480*480 pixels).
2. **Backup the Original Image**:
    
    Before replacing the image, back up the original one:
    
    ```bash
    sudo cp /boot/splash/logo.bmp /boot/splash/logo.bmp.bak
    ```
    
3. **Replace the Image**:
    
    Copy your custom image over the default one:
    
    ```bash
    sudo cp /path/to/your/logo.bmp  /boot/splash/logo.bmp
    ```
    

By following these steps, you can easily replace the default OS, boot splash image with your custom logo. Backing up the original image ensures that you can revert to the default logo if needed, your custom image will be displayed during the boot process, giving your system a personalised touch.
